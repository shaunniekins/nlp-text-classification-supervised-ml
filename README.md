## Setting Up Anaconda for Text Classification with UAQTE Datasets

### Installation

1. Download the Anaconda installer (.sh file) from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/download

2. Navigate to the Downloads directory:

```bash
cd Downloads/
```

3. Execute the downloaded Anaconda installer script:
